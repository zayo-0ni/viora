            We originally built this as our own personal client. We love Stremio so much and wanted
            to put our own spin on a protocol we use almost daily. It started off as a simple clean
            player, and as our friends started using it too, it grew into something bigger: watch
            together, insta play, and a lot more.
          </p>
          <p>A special thank you to the team at Stremio-Addons. Please consider supporting them.</p>
          <p>
            This little footnote area we intend to keep unprofessional as opposed to the rest
            of this project. We hope you enjoy!
